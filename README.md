##### Classical Machine Learning
`Classical_Models.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook containing various classical models for image classification. The model explored include:
- Linear SVM
- Random Forest
- TODO add: K-nearest neighbours

##### Numpy Neural Net
This is a fully connected, feed-forward neural net, implemented from scratch using only Numpy.
- `homecooked_NN.py` contains the Neural net class.
- `handmade_NN.ipynb` contains the Jupyter Notebok used in the training.

##### Convolutional Autoencoder
`conv_autoencoder.ipynb` contains a convolutional autoencoder, which was tested as a potential de-noising option.
